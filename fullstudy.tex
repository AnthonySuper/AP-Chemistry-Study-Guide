\section{Stoichiometry}
Stoichiometry refers to the process of determining moles and other measurements of a substance.

\subsection{Balancing}

There must be equal numbers of substances on both sides of a given equation (unless a nuclear reaction is taking place). 

Here is an unbalanced reaction:
\ce{C8H18 + O2 -> CO2 + H2O}.
In order to balance it, there must be an equal number of substances on both sides. For this particular equation, we will handle carbon first:
\ce{C8H18 + O2 -> 8CO2 + H2O}. Now we must balance the hydrogens: \ce{C8H18 + O2 -> 8CO2 + 9H20}. Note how we have excess oxygen. We fix that in the next step, multiplying everything by two in order to get rid of the fraction: \ce{2C8H18 + 9O2  -> 16CO2 + 18H2O}

\subsection{Moles}

There are various forms of a mole:

\begin{tabular}{| c | c | c|}
\hline
Gas at STP & Particles & Grams \\
\hline
22.4 & $ 6.02 \times 10^{23} $ & Molar Mass \\ 
\hline
\end{tabular}

\subsection{Types of Reactions}
\subsubsection{Single Replacement}
Generally ionic, this reaction involves one ion swapping with another. \ce{Cu + AgNO3 -> Ag + Cu(NO3)2}. 
\subsubsection{Double Replacement}
Generally ionic, this reaction involves one ion swapping with another. 
\ce{FeS + 2HCl -> FeCl2 + H2S}
\subsubsection{Synthesis}
Two molecules fusing into one. \ce{2H2 + O2 -> 2H2O}
\subsubsection{Decomposition}
One molecule becoming two or more. 
\ce{2HgO -> 2Hg + O2}
\subsubsection{Combustion}
A special reaction. Some kind of hydrocarbon combines with oxygen to produce a lot of heat, carbon dioxide, and water.
\ce{2C8H18 + 9O2  -> 16CO2 + 18H2O}

\section{Energy and Enthalpy}
\subsection{Definitions}
\begin{description}
\item[Enthalpy] a thermodynamic quantity equivalent to the total heat content of a system. It is equal to the internal energy of the system plus the product of pressure and volume.

\item[Specific Heat] The amount of Enthalpy required to raise one gram of a substance by 1 degree Kelvin. 
The amount of heat absorbed by a substance, q, is equal to the product of its specific heat (s), its mass, and its temperature change. $ q = s \times m \times \Delta T $

\item[Joule:] SI unit of work or energy. Equal to the work done by a force of one newton when its point of application moves one meter in the direction of the force.
\end{description}
\subsection{Types of Reaction}
An \textbf{endothermic} reaction is one in which $ \Delta H $ is positive. The $ \Delta T $ will be positive. The system absorbs energy. An \textbf{exothermic} reaction in which $ \Delta H $ is negative. The $ \Delta T $ is also negative. The system releases heat into the surroundings.

It takes energy to break chemical bonds. At some point, it will take more energy to break the bonds than the energy the bonds will release when broken. 
\section{Acids and Bases}
\subsection{Definitions}
\begin{description}
\item[Br\o nsted-Lowry Acids:] substances with dissociate in an aqueous solution to give \ce{H+} ions
\item[Br\o nstead-Lowry Bases:] substances with dissociate in an aqueous solution to receive \ce{H+} ions
\item[Arrhenius Acid:] increases \ce{H+} concentration
\item[Arrhenius Base:] increases \ce{OH-} concentration
\item[Neutral Solution:] when the concentration of \ce{H+} is equal to the concentration of \ce{OH-}
\end{description}
\subsection{Useful Equations}
\[
	\text{Ka} = \frac{\text{Concentration of Products}}{\text{Concentration of Reactants}}
\]

\[
	\text{pH} = -\log{ \text{[ \ce{H+}  ]} }
\]

\[
	\text{pOH} = -\log{ \text{[ \ce{OH-}  ]} }
\]

\[
	14 = \text{pH} + \text{pOH}
\]

\[
	\text{pH} = \text{pKa} - \log{ \frac{\text{[Ha]}}{\text{[A-]}}}
\]
\subsection{Strong Acids and Bases}
\begin{tabular}{| p{.5\linewidth} | p{.5\linewidth} |}
\hline
Strong Acids & Strong Bases \\
\hline
\ce{HI} & \ce{NaOH} \\
\hline
\ce{HBr} & \ce{KOH} \\
\hline
\ce{HClO4} & \ce{LiOH} \\
\hline
\ce{HCl} & \ce{RbOH} \\
\hline
\ce{HClO3} & \ce{CsOh} \\
\hline
\ce{H2SO4} & \ce{Ca(OH)2} \\
\hline
& \ce{Ba(OH)2} \\
\hline
& \ce{Sr(OH)2} \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\subsection{Conjugate Acids and Bases}
A \textbf{Conjugate Acid} or \textbf{Conjugate Base} is the salt of the acid or base. For example, the conjugate base of  \ce{H2O} is \ce{OH-}, and the conjugate base of \ce{CH3COOH} can be \ce{CH3OONA}. The important part in the preceding example is the \ce{CH3OO}. Any additional ion will still make it a conjugate base.
\subsubsection{Buffer}
A \textbf{buffer} is a solution which resists change in pH. A buffer is able to resist pH change because the two components (conjugate acids and conjugate base) are present in the solution in appreciable amounts. The conjugate base neutralizes any added acid, and the conjugate acid neutralizes any base. Adding more water allows more of the acid or base to dissolve, causing the pH to remain the same. Removing water has the opposite effect, for a net equal pH.
\subsection{ICE Table}
Example: What is the pH of a 0.020 M Solution of Hydrosulfuric Acid, a diprotic acid. Remember that this acid releases two protons.
\begin{enumerate}
\item 
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|}
\hline
Substance & \ce{H2S} & \ce{H+} & \ce{HS-} \\
\hline
Initial & 0.002 M & 0 & 0 \\
\hline
Change & -x & +x & + x \\
\hline
Equilibrium & $ 0.020 - x $ & x & x \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\item
\[
	\text{Ka} = \frac{\text{[\ce{H+}][\ce{HS-}]}}{\text{[\ce{H2S}]}}
\]
\item
\[
	\frac{x^2}{0.02}  = 11\times 10^{-7}
\]
\item
\[
	x^2 = (0.02)(1.1\times 10^{-7})
\]
\item

	 \[ \text{[\ce{H+}]} = x = \sqrt{2.2 \times 10^{-9} } = 4.69 \times 10^{-5} \]
	
\item
\[
	\text{pH} = -\log{\text{[\ce{H+}]}} = -\log{4.69 \times 10^{-5}} = 4.3287
\]

\end{enumerate}
\subsection{Titration}
A \textbf{Titration} is a way to determine the concentration of an unknown acid or base. Simply add a known base (or acid, if you are titrating a base) and graph the pH values as you add it. Eventually, the graph's slope will become very steep. The center of this slope steepness is the point of equilibrium. For strong acids or bases, this equilibrium will be 7. A weak acid or base will be above or below 7, respectively.
